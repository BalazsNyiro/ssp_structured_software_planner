 - ssp is a program planner program.
   but I need to plan a program - 
   so I write it without program supported planning,
   Later I can refactor :-)

 - what is it:
   - program model in JSON
   - execution displayed in multi-view model
   - it's easier to understand a working logic 
     in execution instead of a frozen moment
